              We may provide you with new offers that we think may interest you.
              The terms of these offers may differ from the standard terms on

            <h2>Account Information</h2>
            <p>
              We need information about you to manage your Account. This
              includes: (1) your legal name; (2) a valid mailing address and
              residential address (if different) with acceptable proof; (3) your
              date of birth; (4) your ID or other government identification; (5)

            </p>

            <p>
              We may give you a personal identification number (PIN). For
              security reasons, you may have to provide the PIN before you are
              able to use your Card. Keep your PIN secure. Do not write it down,
              give it to anyone, or keep it with your Card. If you lose your
              Card or believe the confidentiality of your PIN has been
              compromised for any reason, you must contact Customer Service
              immediately.
            </p>

            <h2>Authorized Users</h2>
            <p>
              If you ask us to issue a Card to any other person, they are an
              Authorized User. We may require certain information about them. We
              may limit their ability to use your Card. They may have access to
              certain information about your Account. You will be responsible
              for their use of the Account and anyone else they allow to use
              your Account, even if you did not want, or agree to, that use.
            </p>
            <h2>Removing an Authorized User:</h2>
            <p>
              If you want to remove an Authorized User from your Account, you
              must contact Customer Service and request their removal. You also
              must immediately destroy all Cards in their possession and cancel
              any arrangements they may have set up on your Account.
            </p>

            <p>
              They will be able to use your Account until you have notified us
              that you are removing them from your Account. During this time,
              you will still be responsible for all amounts they charge to your
              Account. You will be responsible even if these amounts do not
              appear on your Account until later.
            </p>

            <p>
              Authorized Users may remove themselves from your Account upon
              request. We reserve the right to remove them from your Account for
              any reason. To remove them from your Account, we may close your
              existing Account and issue a new Card with a new Account number.
            </p>

            <h2>Your Promise to Pay</h2>
            <p>
              You promise to pay us all amounts due on your Account. This
              includes amounts where you did not sign a purchase slip or other
              documents for the transaction. We will treat transactions made
              without presenting your actual Card (such as for mail, telephone,
              Internet, or mobile device purchases) the same as if you used the
              Card in person. If you let someone else use your Card, you are
              responsible for all transactions that person makes.
            </p>

            <h2>Statements</h2>
            <p>
              We will generally send or make available to you one Statement for
              all Cards on your Account at the end of each Billing Cycle.
            </p>

            <p>
              Under certain circumstances, the law may not require us to send or
              make available to you a Statement or may prohibit us from doing
              so.
            </p>

            <h2>Disputed Transactions</h2>
            <p>
              You must inspect each Statement you receive. Tell us about any
              errors or questions you have, as described in the “Billing Rights
              Summary” on your Statement and other Truth-in Lending Disclosures.
              If you do not notify us of an error, we will assume that all
              information on the Statement is correct. If we credit your Account
              for all or part of a disputed transaction, you give us all your
              rights against others regarding that transaction. You will also:
              (1) give us any information about the disputed transaction, if we
              ask; (2) not pursue any claim or reimbursement of the transaction
              amount from the merchant or any other person; and (3) help us get
              reimbursement from others.
            </p>

            <h2>No Warranties</h2>
            <p>
              We are not responsible for any claim you may have regarding the
              purchase of goods or services made with your Card beyond your
              rights described in the “Billing Rights Summary” on your
              Statement.
            </p>

            <h2>Lost or Stolen Card</h2>
            <p>
              If your Card is lost or stolen or if you think someone else may be
              using your Card or Account number without your permission, you
              must contact Customer Service immediately. You will not be
              responsible for transactions on your Account that we find are
              unauthorized, after the card is reported lost or stolen. If we
              reimburse you for unauthorized transactions, you will help us
              investigate, pursue, and get reimbursement from the wrongdoer.
              Your help includes giving us documents in a form that we request.
            </p>

            <h2>Interest Charges and Fees</h2>
            <p>
              We will charge Interest Charges and Fees to your Account as
              disclosed on your Statement and other Truth-in-Lending
              Disclosures. In general, Interest Charges begin to accrue from the
              day a transaction occurs. However, we will not charge you interest
              on any new transactions posted to the purchase Segment of your
              Account if you paid the total balance across all Segments of your
              Account in full by the due date on your Statement each month.
            </p>

            <p>
              From time to time, we may give you offers that allow you to pay
              less than the total balance and avoid Interest Charges on new
              purchase Segment transactions. If we do, we will provide details
              in the specific offer. We will generally treat Fees as purchase
              transactions unless otherwise specified below. These Fees apply to
              your Account only if your Truth-in-Lending Disclosures provide for
              them. We may increase your Interest Charges and Fees as described
              in the Changes to Your Agreement section or in your
              Truth-in-Lending Disclosures.
            </p>

            <h2>Membership Fee</h2>
            <p>
              If your Account has a membership Fee, we may charge the first
              membership Fee either on the day you activate your Card or on the
              day when you use your Account, whichever occurs first. If your
              Account terms include a $0 introductory Fee, we may charge the
              first Fee when the introductory period ends. If it is an annual
              Fee, we may then charge it approximately once per year. If it is a
              monthly Fee, we may charge it each Billing Cycle.
            </p>

            <h2>Late Payment Fee</h2>
            <p>
              We may charge you this Fee if we do not receive your payment as
              instructed on your Statement by the payment due date.
            </p>

            <h2>Returned Payment Fee</h2>
            <p>
              We may charge you this Fee each time your financial institution
              for any reason rejects a payment you make to us.
            </p>

            <h2>Stop Payment Fee</h2>
            <p>
              We may charge you this Fee each time you ask us to (1) stop
              payment on an Access Check or (2) renew an existing stop payment
              order.
            </p>

            <h2>Cash Advance Fee</h2>
            <p>
              We may charge you this Fee each time you take out a Cash Advance.
              We will treat this Fee as a Cash Advance transaction.
            </p>

            <h2>Transfer Fee</h2>
            <p>
              We may charge you this Fee each time you make a Transfer. We will
              charge the Fee to the same Segment where we post the Transfer.
            </p>

            <h2>Transactions Made in Foreign Currencies</h2>
            <p>
              If you make a transaction in a foreign currency, the Payment Card
              Network will convert it into a U.S. dollar amount. The Payment
              Card Network will use its own currency conversion procedures. The
              conversion rate in effect on the processing date may differ from
              the rate in effect on the transaction date that appears on your
              Statement. We may adjust the currency exchange rate or charge
              additional currency conversion Fees.
            </p>

            <h2>Minimum Payment</h2>
            <p>
              You may be required to pay us at least the minimum payment amount
              by the payment due date.
            </p>

            <h2>Your Statement will tell you:</h2>
            <p>
              The minimum payment due, (2) your new balance, (3) the payment due
              date, and (4) an explanation of when the payment must reach us for
              us to consider it received as of that date. Returns and other
              credits to your Account will reduce your Account balance, but they
              will not change your minimum payment amount. In addition to the
              minimum payment, you may pay all or part of the total balance on
              your Account. But you must still pay at least the minimum payment
              amount each month, even if you paid more than the minimum payment
              due on the previous Statement. We will continue to charge Interest
              Charges during Billing Cycles when you carry a balance regardless
              of whether your Statement includes a minimum payment that is due.
              If your Account is 180 days past due, is part of a bankruptcy
              proceeding or is otherwise charged off, the total balance is
              immediately due and payable.
            </p>

            <h2>Making Payments</h2>
            <p>
              Your payment must be made in U.S. dollars from a U.S. deposit
              account in a form acceptable to us. We do not accept cash payments
              through the mail. You may not make payments with funds from your
              Account or any other credit account with us or any other company.
              You will be advised of the methods in which you may make payments
              to this account. We are not responsible if any financial
              institution rejects a payment made using our payment services. If
              you ask someone else to make a payment for you, we may provide
              that person with limited Account information necessary to set up
              and process that payment. We may also refuse to accept that
              payment. If we do accept it, you will be responsible for that
              payment even if a financial institution rejects it.
            </p>

            <h2>Payment Processing</h2>
            <p>
              We may accept and process payments without losing any of our
              rights. We may delay the availability of credit until we confirm
              that your payment has cleared. This may happen even if we credit
              your payment to your Account. We may resubmit and collect returned
              payments electronically. If necessary, we may adjust your Account
              to correct errors, process returned and reversed payments, and
              handle similar issues. When you send us an Item as payment, you
              authorize us to make a one- time electronic fund transfer from
              your deposit account. You also authorize us to process the payment
              as an Item. We may withdraw the funds from your deposit account as
              early as the same day we receive your payment. You will not
              receive your Item back from your bank. We will provide additional
              information about this process on your Statement. We may use the
              information from an Item to create an electronic image. We may
              collect and return the image electronically. This electronic image
              may also be converted to a substitute check and may be processed
              in the same way we would process an Item. We will not be
              responsible if an Item you provide has physical features that when
              imaged result in it not being processed as you intended.
            </p>

            <h2>How We Apply Your Payments</h2>
            <p>
              Your Account may have Segments with different Annual Percentage
              Rates (APR). For example, purchases may have a lower APR than Cash
              Advances. If your Account has Segment balances with different
              APRs, here is how we apply payments in a Billing Cycle: (1) We
              generally apply credits and payments up to your minimum payment
              first to the balance with the lowest Interest Rate, and then to
              balances with higher APRs. We apply any part of your payment
              exceeding your minimum payment to the balance with the highest
              APR, and then to balances with lower APRs.
            </p>

            <h2>Items with Restrictive Words, Conditions, or Instructions</h2>
            <p>
              You must mail all Items bearing restrictive words, conditions,
              limitations, or special instructions to:{" "}
              <a href="mailto:support@futswap.io">support@futswap.io</a>. This
              also includes all accompanying communications. If you make such a
              payment or send any accompanying communications to any other
              address, we may reject it and return it to you. We may also accept
              it and process it without losing any of our rights.
            </p>

            <h2>Credit Balances</h2>
            <p>
              We may reject and return any payment that creates or adds to a
              credit balance on your Account. Any credit balance we allow will
              not be available until we confirm that your payment has cleared.
            </p>

            <h2>Account Default</h2>
            <p>
              You will be in default if: (1) you do not make any payment when it
              is due; (2) any payment you make is rejected, not paid or cannot
              be processed; (3) you exceed a credit limit; (4) you file or
              become the subject of a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding; (5)
              you are unable or unwilling to repay your obligations, including
              upon death or legally declared incapacity; (6) we determine that
              you made a false, incomplete or misleading statement to us, or you
              otherwise tried to defraud us; or (7) you do not comply with any
              term of this Agreement or any other agreement with us. If you are
              in default, we may take certain actions with respect to your
              Account. For example, depending on the default, we may take the
              following actions, without notifying you, unless the law says that
              we must give you notice: (1) charge you Fees, or change the APRs
              and Fees on your Account, if provided in your Truth-in-Lending
              Disclosures; (2) close or suspend your Account; (3) lower your
              credit limit(s); (4) demand that you immediately pay the total
              balance owing on your Account; (5) continue to charge you Interest
              Charges and Fees as long as your balance remains outstanding;
              and/or (6) file a lawsuit against you, or pursue another action
              that is not prohibited by law. If we file a lawsuit, you agree to
              pay our court costs, expenses, and attorney fees, unless the law
              does not allow us to collect these amounts.
            </p>

            <h2>Communications</h2>
            <p>
              You agree that we may communicate with you by mail, telephone,
              email, fax, prerecorded message, automated voice, text message, or
              other means allowed by law regarding your Account. You agree that
              we may contact you at any telephone number (including a mobile
              telephone number that you provide us) and use an automated
              telephone dialing system or similar device to do so. You agree

              others. Late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your
              Account may be reflected in your credit report. When you write,
              tell us the specific information that you believe is incorrect and
              why you believe it is incorrect. We may obtain and use credit,

            </p>

            <h2>Closing or Suspending Your Account</h2>
            <p>
              You may contact Customer Service to ask us to close your Account.
              We may close or suspend your Account at any time and for any
              reason permitted by law, even if you are not in default. If we
              close or suspend your Account for any reason, you must stop using
              your Card. You must also cancel all billing arrangements set up on
              the Account. If we close or permanently suspend your Account, you
              must return or destroy all Cards. You must still pay us all
              amounts you owe on the Account.
            </p>

            <h2>Changes to Your Agreement</h2>
            <p>
              At any time, we may add, delete, or change any term of this
              Agreement, unless the law prohibits us from doing so. We will give
              you notice of any changes as required by law. We may notify you of
              changes on your Statement or in a separate notice. Our notice will

              will describe any rights you have in connection with the changes.
              Your variable APRs (if applicable) can go up or down as the index
              for the rate goes up or down. If we increase your APRs for any
              other reason, or if we change your Fees or other terms of your
              Account, we will notify you as required by law.
            </p>
